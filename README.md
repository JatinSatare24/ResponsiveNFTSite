# Responsive NFT Landing Page

## 🎯 Project Objective
The primary goal of this project was to practice **Responsive Web Design (RWD)**. I focused on taking a high-fidelity design typical of the NFT/Web3 industry and implementing it using a mobile-first approach to ensure layout stability across all device categories.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Semantic HTML5:** Used for structural clarity and accessibility.
* **CSS3 (Vanilla):** Utilized Flexbox and CSS Grid for complex layouts without relying on external frameworks.
* **Mobile-First Workflow:** Developed the CSS starting from a 375px viewport and used `@media` queries to scale up to 1440px+ (Desktop).
* **UI Polish:** Implemented hover transitions, dark-mode color palettes, and container-based layouts.

## 🔍 Key Challenges Solved
* **Image Aspect Ratios:** Ensuring NFT card images maintained their proportions without stretching or shrinking on fluid layouts.
* **Navigation:** Building a responsive navbar that shifts from a mobile-friendly layout to a standard desktop header.

## 🚧 Project Limitations
* **Static UI:** This is a frontend-only project. There is no blockchain integration, smart contract connectivity, or backend database.
* **No Frameworks:** Purposefully built with Vanilla CSS to strengthen fundamental CSS knowledge before moving to Tailwind or Bootstrap.

## 🚀 Local Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
3. Use Chrome DevTools (F12) to test the responsiveness across various device presets.
